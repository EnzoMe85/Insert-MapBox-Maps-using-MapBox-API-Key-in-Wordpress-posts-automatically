This function was written in PHP for Wodpress <3

If you like, name me in your project, I'm Enzo Mele <3 If I have been useful to you, put a star on this project or a token of appreciation <3

------ SMALL USER MANUAL :) ------

The function gives the possibility to insert in each new post through 2 fields (latitude and longitude). Once the post has been saved (and automatically the coordinates) the map will appear at the bottom of the post.

Obviously, if you don't fill in the fields, no map will be added.

You can also use the created map anywhere else in the post by simply using the short code: [my_map]

Below you will find all the instructions for implementing the function in your wordpress site:

1)Add the following code to your active theme's functions.php file (or use the snippets plugin)

2)Replace "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" with your MapBox token access..
